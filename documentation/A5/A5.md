## Backend unit test case

### check_ticket

The backend method check_ticket() is a method used to assure that the ticket information is
satisfied. For instance that the ticket name meets the inteded requirements of being alphanumeric
only and space being allowed only if it is not the first or last character.

Possible inputs are strings containing only the certain elements. Possible outputs are either
True or False. If the input meets the requirements then the output is true.

| Partition | Input                                   | Test Case Input | Test Case Expected Output |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| P1        | Non-alphanumeric                        | "@Test"         | False                     |
| P2        | First character is a space              | " Test"         | False                     |
| P3        | last character is a space               | "Test "         | False                     |
| P4        | Name can't have more than 60 characters | "testTicketxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" | False                     |
| P5        | otherwise (not P1, P2, P3, or P4)       | "test ticket"   | True                      |

All test cases follow the following format:

Actions:
 - Pass test case input to check_ticket()
 - Assert that the return is equal to test case expected output

## Modification

### Check_Ticket Modifications

| Modification | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Added Check_Update_Ticket | Added a backend function to seperate the ticket checks for update and sell, because sell does not need to check for the ticket in the database and update does. Changed the frontend function update_post to reflect this change |
