## Test plan

Test case documentation is stored under /documentation/A1/

When testing the frontend, mocking is used in place of the backend. Selenium is used to control the browser
to simulate a user action corresponding to each test case. Testing is done automatically with github actions each time
new code is pushed to the repository. Github actions runs a fresh environment with a python installation
and dependencies. The application is then tested with pytest.

Test case code will be stored under /qa327_test/
