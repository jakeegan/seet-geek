## Test Plan

### Environments
Automated tests will take place in a Linux cloud environment. Local debugging and testing will occur in a Windows environment.

### Budget Management 
With a GitHub Pro plan, private repositories have a limit of 3000 action minutes per 6 days and a maximum storage of 2 GB. To ensure this limit is not reached, the team will use the following guidelines:
- Tests that are critical to meeting functional specification should be given priority. 
- Avoid redundant or cloned tests to minimize unnecessary minutes usage.
- Try to push big code changes, rather than many small ones to reduce minutes usage.
- Run pytest in our local environment before pushing changes.
- Pull requests for new tests and code review of the new tests by all members to ensure quality of the tests.
- Reevaluate budget management if 90% of the action minutes limit is reached.

### Testing Levels & Organization
In the table below, test cases `R1` through `R8` are divided into different levels: frontend unit, backend unit, and integration tests. Integration tests are those that test functionality of both the frontend and backend together. Furthermore, frontend tests mock the backend so that it can be assumed the backend is functioning as expected. In the case of this project, the frontend and backend are part of the same program.

As mentioned in _Budget Management_ above, tests critical to meeting functional specification should be given priority. Therefore, test cases pertaining to the backend should be ordered first. Then would come frontend testing, followed by integration testing. In order, that is:

Backend Unit testing --> Frontend Unit Testing --> Integration Testing
