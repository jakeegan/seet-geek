# Assignment 3

## Backend unit test cases

### Jake
The backend method check_password() is a method used to satisfy password requirement R1.8:
Password has to meet the required complexity: minimum length 6, at least one upper case, at least one lower case, and at least one special character

Possible inputs is a string combination of numbers, letters, and special characters. Possible outputs are either True or False. The function returns True if the input meets the requirements and False if the input doesn't meet the requirements.

| Partition | Input                             | Test Case Input | Test Case Expected Output |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| P1        | length less than 6                | "Test!"         | False                     |
| P2        | no upper case                     | "testing!"      | False                     |
| P3        | no lower case                     | "TESTING!"      | False                     |
| P4        | no special characters             | "Testing"       | False                     |
| P5        | otherwise (not P1, P2, P3, or P4) | "Testing!"      | True                      |

All test cases follow the following format:

Actions:
-Pass test case input to check_password()
-Assert that the return is equal to test case expected output
